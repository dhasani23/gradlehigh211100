    "summary": "Fixed initial build issues in the common module, but there are still issues in the product-catalog module. The main challenges faced include: 1) Incompatibility between Spring Boot 1.5.22 and Gradle 4.10.2, 2) Missing classes and methods in the product-catalog module, 3) Type mismatches between DTO classes in different packages. Progress made: 1) Fixed DateTimeUtil and MathUtil classes in common module, 2) Added proper JPA dependencies, 3) Updated build configuration to be consistent across modules. Next steps would be to fix the product-catalog module issues, particularly the missing DTO classes and repository methods."
